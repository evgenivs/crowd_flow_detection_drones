# Density-based clustering with fully-convolutional networks for crowd flow detection from drones

In this repository, we provide code for our paper under review. We propose a crowd flow detection method for video sequences shot by a drone. The method is based on a fully convolutional network that performs crowd clustering. The detected centroids of dense crowd areas are tracked in consecutive frames. The method was tested on the Crowd Counting datasets of the VisDrone challenge.
